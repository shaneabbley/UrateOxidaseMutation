# UrateOxidaseMutation

This repository is the culmination of the work I put into my senior year research project. The first file of interest is the InitialDraftGrantProposal pdf. This file was intended to test my ability to research and write about an advanced scientific inquiry as well as to design a logical and practical experiment to test a hypothesis.

The first experiment performed was a determination of the molar absorptivity of uric acid. Although, a relatively simple experiment, it was a good initiation for the study of urate oxidase. We learned the basic mechanism as well as the scientific significance of research relating to urate/uric acid/urate oxidase/gout.

The first component lab report focused on the initial preparation for our mutation. That is, we purchased primers, added them to our carrier vectors (the plasmids), inserted them into cells, testing for the presence of the mutation, and outsourced another test for the presence of our mutation. It is important to note that we were required to alter the mutation that I suggested in my grant proposal, (G-286-A) in favor of a mutation that would be more likely to succeed (F-182-Y).

The second component saw us remove the hyperexpressed proteins from the competent cells. Afterwards, we performed several protein purification steps including affinity chromatography. We also tested the activity every step of the way. We were very successful at this point in the experiment and were prepared to characterize our mutation in component III.

The final component was the culmination of this quarters work on our urate oxidase mutation. We characterized the mutation using Michaelis-Menten kinetics, we visualized the mutant and wild type enzyme in Pymol and we used these results to justify the effect the mutation has on the structure and function of the enzyme.

The UrateMassSpectroscopy folder contains a follow up experiment where we identified the presence of our mutation using two separate mass spectroscopy techniques (MALDI-TOF and ESI-TOF). There is a research poster also included in this folder, which we presented to professors, students, and other guests.

An experiment determining the assignments of allantoins nuclei using NMR is also included in the AllantoinNMRAnalysis folder. Although not focused on urate oxidase, we performed this experiment primarily on the final product of the urate oxidase metabolic pathway and thus I felt it prudent to include it here.

An additional experiment where we performed conformational analysis on gamma amino-butyric acid and allantoin was added. This experiment, conformation analysis of allantoin and gaba, focused on running molecular mechanics simulations on the molecules of interest. In particular we performed a conformational search on gaba and a Monte Carlo simulation on allantoin.

The EnzymeKineticsExperiment folder contains an experiment in which we attempted to develop a urate oxidase kinetics model. This model attempted to account for nonlinearity in the absorption spectrum. We also performed two experiments on glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in order to learn about it's mechanism.

I also included a small presentation I gave during class. This presentation focused on how we utilized computer-assisted sequence analysis during various projects in the class. I also describe historical and modern methods that computers use to perform these calculations.
