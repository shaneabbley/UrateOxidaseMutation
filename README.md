# UrateOxidaseMutation

This repository is the culmination of the work I put into my senior year research project. The first file of interest is the InitialDraftGrantProposal pdf. This file was intended to test my ability to research and write about an advanced scientific inquiry as well as to design a logical and practical experiment to test a hypothesis.

The first experiment performed was a determination of the molar absorptivity of uric acid. Although, a relatively simple experiment, it was a good initiation for the study of urate oxidase. We learned the basic mechanism as well as the scientific significance of research relating to urate/uric acid/urate oxidase/gout.

The first component lab report focused on the initial preparation for our mutation. That is, we purchased primers, added them to our carrier vectors (the plasmids), inserted them into cells, instructed the cells to produce significant quantities of our product, and outsourced the testing for the presence of our mutation. It is important to note that we were required to alter the mutation that I suggested in my grant proposal, (G-286-A) in favor of a mutation that would be more likely to succeed (F-182-Y).

I also included a small presentation I gave during class. This presentation focused on how we utilized computer-assisted sequence analysis during various projects in the class. I also describe historical and modern methods that computers use to perform these calculations.
