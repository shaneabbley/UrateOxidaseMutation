# UrateOxidaseMutation

This repository is the culmination of the work I put into my senior year research project. The first file of interest is the InitialDraftGrantProposal pdf. This file was intended to test my ability to research and write about an advanced scientific inquiry as well as to design a logical and practical experiment to test a hypothesis.

The first experiment performed was a determination of the molar absorptivity of uric acid. Although, a relatively simple experiment, it was a good initiation for the study of urate oxidase. We learned the basic mechanism as well as the scientific significance to research relating to urate/uric acid/urate oxidase/gout.
